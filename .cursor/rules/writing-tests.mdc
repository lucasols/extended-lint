- Tests should be in `src/rules` with the same name of the rule and the .test.ts extension
- Use the same test strucuture of [prefer-single-line-if.test.ts](mdc:src/rules/prefer-single-line-if.test.ts)
- Also run the written tests with `pnpm test ...` to check if the tests pass
- If i ask you to adjust the code implementation and not only the tests:
  - Run the written tests with `pnpm test ...` to check if the tests pass
  - Always run the tests without asking
