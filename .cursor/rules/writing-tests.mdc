description: use these rules whenever are tests involved, or code changes that may affect existing tests
globs: src/**/*
alwaysApply: false

- Tests should be in `src/rules` with the same name of the rule and the .test.ts extension
- Use the same test strucuture of [prefer-single-line-if.test.ts](mdc:src/rules/prefer-single-line-if.test.ts)
- Also run the written tests with `pnpm test ...` to check if the tests pass
- If i ask you to adjust the code implementation and not only the tests:
  - Run the written tests with `pnpm test ...` to check if the tests pass
  - Always run the tests without asking

- If the tests fail adjust the implementation, not the tests! Except if the tests are fundamentally wrong
